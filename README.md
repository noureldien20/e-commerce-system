## Shipping Assumptions
- Shipping fees are calculated based on total weight of shippable items.
- Fixed rate of 5 currency units per kg is used as the shipping cost.
- Shipping is handled by a simple ShippingService that just prints item names and weights to the console.

## Design Assumptions
- No persistent storage is used â€” all data is held in memory.
- No concurrency or multi-user support is implemented.
